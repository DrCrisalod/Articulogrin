We propose a simple setup which that the calculation of the current
density as a function of position within an electrochemical cell used
to produce porous Silicon structures with a controlled gradient in their
index of refraction. We produced samples under several conditions and
characterized them with scanning electron microscopy, and
ultraviolet-visible-near infrared reflectance spectroscopy. Our
results allow us to obtain from experiments on a single or just a few
samples a full characterization of the dependence of porosity,
dielectric function and speed of attack on the current density and on
position, so that novel nonhomogeneous devices may be designed and
built.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\notaL{Debiste poner etiquetas en todas las subsecciones y secciones, y

\notaL{No entiendo nada de la introducción}
The structural properties of nanostructured materials  has  received a
considerable attention,  and a large research effort has been devoted
to them \cite{I1}. We found a great way to go for future
technological  explorations,  countless  challenges and  that  open a
range of possibilities to develop further  study  on these
issues\cite{I2}. Porous silicon (PS) is a versatile nanostructured
material and an excellent candidate as a technological platform for
different sensing applications \cite{I3, I4}, due to its easy
manufacturing,  large surface area, high surface reactivity,  and
moreover, its optical transduction capacity.  Photonic crystals are
multilayer dielectric structures that have periodicity in the
dielectric function along one direction \cite{I5}. It has numerous
studies for high reflectivity and the ability to adjust  the photonic
prohibited  band (PBG)\cite{I6} , which leads to possible applications
such as filters\cite{I7}, optical switches\cite{I8}, omnidirectional
mirrors\cite{I9}, waveguides for PC \cite{I10} etc. In the
conventional manufacturing of PS the desired result  is to obtain
homogeneous samples (same structural characteristics) from the
periphery  to the center  of the electrochemically  attacked area.
However, with an asymmetric anodizing configuration,  samples with a
lateral gradient in terms of pore size and thickness of the porous
layer are obtained \cite{I101}. In this configuration,  the face of
the platinum  electrode (cathode)  is relatively maintained
perpendicular  to the surface of the Si substrate (anode) at one end
of the cell, so that the distribution of the current within the
electrolyte  solution varies depending on the distance  of the
electrode due to the resistance of the electrolyte,  resulting  in a
decrease in current density as the distance from the electrode
increases \cite{I102, I103}. The result is a porous surface with
different pore sizes ranging from a few nanometers  to pores on the
order of a few micrometers  \cite{I104}. The dimensions of the pores
obtained on the same chip can be controlled by adjusting the anodizing
current and electrolyte concentration \cite{I11}. Currently, these
types of samples have found their application relevant as optical band
filters \cite{I12}, devices with a multidirectional photonic band
(photonic bar codes) \cite{I13} and mainly as biosensors. In this way,
the effect of different topographies (porosities in the same sample)
on the culture / adhesion of certain cells \cite{I14} is studied,
considerably reducing the number of samples and cost of the study. In
addition, they are also very useful when a biomolecule size-exclusion
technique is required allowing the identification and separation of
these biological compounds \cite{I15}. Recent studies  have shown that
the  combination  of thermal  oxidation  and infiltration of TiO2   by
ALD offers the  opportunity to manufacture  a high index of refraction
of contrast, visibly transparent GRIN \notaL{Define acrónimos antes de
  usarlos}. optical elements from PS
absorbent structures \cite{I16}. A Despite previous research on the
formation of porous silicon with GRIN, type p in manufacturing and
characterization, there was no control of current densities, much less
a model that  explained said lateral  gradient. In this work, we
reported a gradient refractive index (GRIN) structure by varying the
current density on the fabrication of porous silicon photonic
structure. This current density values, depth, and porosity of the
photonic structure were calculated from an electrostatic model for
photonic crystals with a gradient refractive index
(EMPCGRIN). Moreover, the theoretical and experimental studies were
exhibited similar results.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2  we report the effect
of how the current density can be calculated from an electrostatic
model for photonic crystals with gradient refractive index (EMPCGRIN),
demonstrating that there is a direct relation of the gradient
generated by the electrode when it attacks the Silicon sample, we can
see the depth of the structure and its porosity, in each of the
measuring points. In Subsection 2.2 we present a formalism based on
the methods used for the analysis of photonic crystal structures is
the transfer matrix method. We use it to investigate the reflectance
of light in a one-dimensional photonic crystal. In Section 3 we
provide experimental  details about the manufacture of PS dielectric
multilayers and Section 4 we shows the comparison of numerical and
experimental results followed. Finally,  the conclusions given in
Section. 5 \notaL{Checar que esto corresponda a lo que sigue del

\section{Theory: current density}
\label{sec:theory}
\label{sec:calc-curr-dens}
\notaL{check where acronyms are first defined}
A gradient in the optical properties of porous Silicon (PS) systems may be
obtained by electrochemically attacking a Si surface with a position dependent current
density ${\bm j(\bm r)}$, as the porosity and refractive index depend on
the current density, as well as the etching rate and the thickness of the
porous layer. Nevertheless, it is not a simple task to measure the
{\em local} value of $\bm j(\bm r)$ along the surface. This hampers the
design and optimization of well characterized reproducible GRIN PS
structures.\notaL{Tenemos referencias para afirmar esto?} Thus, we
believe a
system for which the current density field may be
easily computed would be useful.
Though $\bm j(\bm r)$ may be numerically calculated for any
given arbitrary experimental setup,  here we propose a particularly
simple setup that allows an expression for the current in terms
of a series that is rapidly convergent and each of whose terms is a
simple analytic function. With this setup it is easy to characterize
the dependence of different properties of interest on the current, and
this allows the design and optimization of diverse GRIN PS devices.

We assume that our electrolytic cell has the shape of a rectangular
prism (see Fig. \ref{f:celda}) with a horizontal base of sides $a$ and $b$, and
filled with the electrolyte up to a height $c$. We assume that the
walls of the cell are insulating while the bottom is completely
covered with the sample, which is an
electrically grounded relatively good conductor. Within the electrolyte we position an electrode
which we assume is a thin conducting wire, insulated from the electrolyte
but for a small tip, which we approximate as a
point current source.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/celdan1}
  \caption{Prism shaped electrolytic cell with a rectangular base of
    sides $a$, $b$ filled with electrolyte up to a height $c$. The
    walls of the cell are insulating and the bottom is completely
    covered by the sample, which is assumed to be a good
    conductor. The tip of the electrode is a thin insulated wire
    with just the tip uncovered and located at $\bm r_0=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ within the
    liquid. The current flows through the electrolyte from the sample
    to the tip.}
  \label{f:celda}
\end{figure}
Within the electrolyte the current density is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:j}
  \bm j=\sigma\bm E,
\end{equation}
with
$\sigma$ the conductivity, $\bm E=-\nabla\phi$ the electric field,
and $\phi$ the electric potential. In a
stationary situation
$\nabla\cdot \bm j = \sigma\nabla\cdot\bm E=0$. Thus, the potential
obeys Laplace's equation within the electrolyte,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:laplace}
\nabla^{2} \phi=0.
\end{equation}
Consider now an arbitrary closed surface
$\mathcal S$
within the electrolyte that surrounds completely the tip of the
electrode. Integrating $ \bm j$ over this surface we obtain
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:I}
\int_{\mathcal S'} d\bm a \cdot \bm j = -I,
\end{equation}
where the prime on $\mathcal S'$ means we remove from the surface a
very small hole through which the wire that feeds the current to the
electrode gets
through, and the sign is consistent with the current direction in
Fig. \ref{f:celda}. Assuming the wire is narrower than any other relevant
distance in the system, we may interpret Eq. \eqref{eq:I} as an
integral over a closed surface of the current \eqref{eq:j} within the
electrolyte, ignoring the actual current within the wire. Thus
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:gauss}
  \int_{\mathcal S} d\bm a \cdot \bm E = -\frac{I}{\sigma}
\end{equation}
Using Gauss's law, we interpret this equation as a source for the
potential in the form of a point charge
\begin{equation}
  q_0 = -\frac{I}{4 \pi \sigma}
\end{equation}
at the position $\bm r_0=(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ of the
tip of the electrode. Note that $q_0$ would be the total charge,
and it shouldn't be further screened through the permittivity of the
electrolyte.

The effective conductivity of the relatively thin sample in contact
with the grounded counter-electrode is large enough that we may assume its
surface $z=0$ is an equipotential.
On the other hand, no current can go across the insulating walls of
the cell, situated at $x=0$, $x=a$,, $y=0$ and $y=b$, nor through the
free surface of the liquid at $z=c$. Thus, the problem to solve is Poisson's
equation with a point charge source
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:poisson}
  \nabla^2\phi=-4\pi q_0\delta(\bm r-\bm r_0),
\end{equation}
with mixed boundary conditions
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ground}
  \phi(x,y,0)=0,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:E0}
E_x(0, y ,z)= E_x(a, y ,z)=E_y(x, 0 ,z)=E_y(x, b
,z)=E_z(x, y ,c)=0.
\end{equation}
This problem may be solved readily using image charge theory \cite{T1,T2}.
The potential within the electrolytic cell coincides
within the region $0\le x\le a$, $0\le y \le b$, $0\le z\le c$
with that an infinite fictitious empty space but for the point charge
$q_0$ at the tip of the electrode at $\bm r_0$, and an array of its fictitious image
charges situated out of the cell. They include an image on the conducting bottom of the
cell, of the opposite charge $-q_0$ and situated at $(x_0, y_0,-z_0)$,
to guarantee that the bottom stays at potential zero.
There are further images on the four walls of the cell, of the same charge $q_0$
and situated at $(-x_0,y_0,z_0)$, $(x_0,-y_0, z_0)$, $(2a-x_0, y_0,
z_0)$ and $(x_0, 2b-y_0,z_0)$ so that, taken one at a time, no current goes across
the corresponding wall. Similarly, there is an image of the same charge $q_0$ at
$(x_0,y_0,2c-z_0)$ so that no current goes across the
surface of the electrolyte. Furthermore, each image charge has to be
further reflected by each of the aforementioned surfaces, yielding
infinitely many new images so that Eqs. \eqref{eq:ground} and
\eqref{eq:E0} hold when all charges are considered together.

\end{figure}
In Fig. \ref{fig:topview} we illustrate the real charge and all of
its images within the plane $z=z_0$. They form a periodic rectangular
lattice with a unit cell of size $2a\times 2b$ and with a basis of
four equal charges $q_0$ situated at the positions $\bm r_0$, $\bm
r_1=(-x_0, y_0, z_0)$, $\bm r_2=(x_0, -y_0, z_0)$ and $\bm r_3=(-x_0,
-y_0, z_0)$. In Fig. \ref{fig:sideview} we show a lateral view of the
image charges within the plane $y=y_0$.

    surface of the sample and the top of the electrolyte (green
    dots). We use solid dots to denote images with the same charge $q_0$
    as that corresponding to the tip of the electrode, and open dots for those of
    opposite charge $-q_0$. The mirror planes that don't invert the charge
    are indicated by blue lines and the mirror plane that inverts the

    which is indicated by wide dashed lines, and with a basis of four
    charges $q_0$ and another four charges $-q_0$. Within this cell,
    we indicate its $G=0$ contribution to the electric field (solid
    arrows, see text).}
  \label{fig:sideview}
\end{figure}
Each plane of charges upon reflection on the surface of the sample at
the bottom of the cell yields an
plane of image charges of the opposite sign, while each reflection
on the surface of the liquid yields a plane of charges of the same
sign. The side view may be interpreted as a periodic rectangular
lattice with a unit cell of size $2a\times 4c$ containing a basis of eight point
charges, four positive and four negative. A projection onto the $yz$
plane would similarly yield a rectangular lattice with a  $2b\times4c$
unit cell. Putting everything together, the problem is that of solving
Poisson's equation within an orthothombic lattice of size
$2a\times2b\times4c$ with a basis of 16 point charges of charge $\pm
q_0$ arranged in positive and negative planes.

The electrostatic potential produced by an infinite array of
charges expressed as a sum in real space of Coulomb terms has ill
convergence properties. The potential can be obtained
using the Ewald summation technique \cite{T3,T4,T5}, which yields
two rapidly converging series, one in real space and another one in reciprocal space.
Nevertheless, as we need the potential and the field to obtain the
current density on the surface of the sample on which  no
real nor image charges lie, we may perform a somewhat simpler planewise
summation, where we first obtain the potential and field produced by a
simple periodic lattice of charges using a fast convergent sum over the 2D
reciprocal vectors, then sum over the charges that form the basis
of the 2D {\em crystal} plane, and finally sum over all the
 planes \cite{T6,T7}.\notaL{¿Estas referencias son relevantes? ¿En verdad
   se define en ellas la suma de Ewald por planos? Dime dónde p.f., en qué
   página. Y checa que todas las referencias tengan que ver con lo que decimos}

We consider first a system made of identical {\em unit} charges
ocuppying the positions $\bm R$ of a 2D Bravais lattice $\{\bm R\}$,
which we will take as a rectangular lattice with lattice parameters
$2a$ and $2b$, and lying, for the time being, at the $z=0$ plane.
The potential it produces obeys
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:poissonRed}
  \nabla^2\phi(\bm r)=-4\pi\sum_{\bm R}\delta(\bm r_\|-\bm
  R)\delta(z)=-\frac{4\pi}{A}\sum_{\bm G}e^{i\bm G\cdot\bm r_\|}\delta(z),
\end{equation}
where $\bm r_\|$ is the projection of the observation position $\bm
r=(x,y,z)$ onto the $xy$ plane,
$\delta(\ldots)$ is Dirac's delta function, $\{\bm G\}$ is the
reciprocal lattice defined through $e^{i\bm G\cdot\bm R}=1$ for all
$\bm R$ and $\bm G$, $A=4ab$ is the area of the unit cell
and we used the Fourier representation of the 2D
periodically repeated delta function. We introduce a 2D Fourier representation for
the potential
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:phifourier}
  \phi(\bm r)=\sum_{\bm G}\phi_{\bm G}(z)e^{i\bm G\cdot\bm r_\|}
\end{equation}
where $\phi_{\bm G}(z)$ is the Fourier coefficient of the potential at
the height $z$. Substitution in Eq. \eqref{eq:poissonRed} yields the
ordinary differential equation
 \begin{eqnarray}
 \frac{d^2}{dz^2}\phi_{\bm G}(z)-G^2\phi_G(z)=
   -\frac{4 \pi}{A} \delta(z),
 \end{eqnarray}
for each coefficient, an homogeneous equation for $z\ne0$ which may be trivially
solved. After applying boundary conditions at $z=0$ and regularity
conditions at infinity, we obtain
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:phiG}
  \phi_{\bm G}(z)=
  \begin{cases}
    -\dfrac{2\pi}{A}\abs{z}&\text{if }G=0,\\
    \dfrac{2 \pi}{AG}  e^{- G \abs{z}}&\text{if }G\neq 0.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The case $G=0$ corresponds to the potential produced by a uniformly charged plane,
while the case $G\ne 0$ is the potential produced by a sinusoidal
charge density on a plane, given by the
symmetric solution that decays exponentially as we get away, upwards
or downwards, from
the source plane. Substituting into Eq. \eqref{eq:phifourier} yields
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:phiG1}
 \phi(\bm r) = -\frac{2 \pi}{A}  \abs{z} +{\sum_{\bm G}}' \frac{2 \pi
   }{AG} e^{- G \abs{z}} e^{i \bm G\cdot\bm r_\|},
 \end{eqnarray}
where the prime indicates that the term $G=0$ should be ommited from
the sum.

We consider now the basis of our 2D lattice, with equal charges at the
four positions $(\pm x_0, \pm y_0,0)$. Each of the corresponding four
sublattices produces a potential as that in Eq. \eqref{eq:phiG1} but
shifted by the corresponding basis vector, yielding
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:phiG4}
  \phi(\bm r) = -\frac{8\pi}{A} \abs{z}
    +{\sum_{\bm G}}' \frac{8\pi}{AG} e^{- G \abs{z}}\cos(G_x x_0)
    \cos(G_y y_0) e^{i \bm G\cdot\bm r_\|}.
\end{equation}
Finally, we shift the origin of Eq. \eqref{eq:phiG4} vertically to each of the planes shown in
Fig. \ref{fig:sideview} and multiply by the corresponding charge $q_0$
or $-q_0$ to obtain the contribution to the total potential. The charge $q_0$ corresponds to
the planes with heights of the form $z_0+4nc$ and $-z_0+(4n+2)c$, with
$n=\ldots-2,-1,0,1,2\ldots$ an arbitrary integer, while the charge
$-q_0$ corresponds to the planes with heights $z_0+(4n+2)c$ and
$-z_0+4(n+1)c$.

We concentrate our attention only on the region $0\le z<z_0$ above the
sample but below the electrode. From
Fig. \ref{fig:sideview} we see that the $G=0$
field has contributions only from the charges at $z_0$ and their
images at $-z_0$, and that this contribution is like that of a parallel plate
capacitor $E_{0z}=-4\pi q_0/ab=-16\pi q_0/A$, which corresponds to the
potential $\phi_0=16\pi q_0 z/A$. Other pairs of contiguous planes of with opposite charges
contribute to the field elsewhere. The contributions to the potential
from the $G\ne0$ terms are simple geometric series that may be summed
over $n$ analytically and yield the total potential
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:phitot}
  \begin{split}
    \phi(\bm r)=&\frac{16\pi q_0}{A}\biggl(z+{\sum_{\bm G}}'\frac{2\sinh
      Gc}{G \sinh 2Gc}\cosh G(c-z_0)\cos G_x x_0 \cos G_y y_0\\
    &\times \sinh Gz\, e^{i\bm G\cdot\bm r_\|}\biggr).
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

Notice that the terms of the sum above converge exponentially to zero
as $G$ increases for any $z$ such that $0\le z <z_0 \le c$, and thus
the sum is convergent. The divergence in the limit $ z
\longrightarrow z_0 $ corresponds to the singularity of the potential
at the position of a point charge, and it is not worrisome, as we are
interested in the field close to bottom $z=0$ of the cell.

The current density normal to the surface may now be obtained as
$j_\perp=-\sigma\partial\phi/\partial z$,
\begin{equation}
  \label{Eq:J}
  \begin{split}
    j_\perp(\bm r) =& \frac{I}{ab}\biggl(1+{\sum_{\bm G}}'\frac{2\sinh
      Gc}{\sinh 2Gc}\cosh G(c-z_0)\cos G_x x_0 \cos G_y y_0\\
    &\times \cosh Gz\, e^{i\bm G\cdot\bm r_\|}\biggr).
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Eq. \eqref{Eq:J} is a very rapidly convergent expression that allows,
in particular, to calculate the current $j_\perp(x,y,0)$ that attacks
the substrate to produce the PS sample.
Integrating over the surface of the sample we verify
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:intj}
  \int_0^adx\int_0^bdy\,j_\perp(\bm r)=I,
\end{equation}
as the contributions of opposite non-null reciprocal vectors cancel
out: as expected, all the charges that leave the sample find
their way  to the cathode across the electrolyte.

Using Eq. \eqref{Eq:J} we can correlate the local current density at
the sample as it is prepared with its geometric, structural and optical
properties.

\end{figure}

In Fig. \ref{fig:DE1} we show a schematic representation of our
experimental setup to manufacture GRIN PS structures.
As dicussed above, we fabricated an electrolytic cell with the shape of a
rectangular prism on the bottom of which we place a Si wafer which makes
electrical contact to a gold plate \notaL{Lo inventé; de qué material es
  el contacto bajo la muestra?} which together make the anode. The
cathode consists of a platinum wire insulated except for a small region
at its tip, which we take as a point current drain.
We also show a schematic drawing of the expected GRIN PS structures,
with a gradient in the porosity, and in the thickness, density and depth
of the resulting pores.

\subsection{Fabrication of GRIN  PS Single Layers}
\label{sec:fabrication-ps-grin}
We manufactured single layer PS structures through electrochemical
anodization of a (100) $p$-type crystalline Si wafer
(resistivity 0.002 - 0.005 $ \Omega\,\text{cm}$), under galvanostatic
conditions. The process was performed at
room temperature,\notaL{OJO. No controlaste la temperatura} with an
electrolytic mixture of aqueous hydrofluoric
acid (HF) (concentration 48\% wt), glycerol (purity 99.8 \% wt) and
ethanol (purity 99.9\% wt) in a 3:7:1 volume ratio. \notaL{Checa que
  todo esto sí corresponda a tus últimas muestras} After the
anodizing process, the samples were rinsed with
ethanol (purity: 99.9 $ \% $  wt). The electrolytic cell had the shape
of a rectangular prism as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:DE1}, with a base of
sides $a=2.01\,\text{cm}$ \notaL{Cambié el número, de acuerdo a unas
  mediciones de Cristian} and $b=1.48\,\text{cm}$, with an uncovered sample area
of about $3\,\text{cm}^2$. The height of the liquid was set at
$c=1\,\text{cm}$. The cathode was a
platinum wire that with a diameter of $0.41\,\text{mm}$ insulated by a
teflon cylinder of external diameter $\,2\text{mm}$, with an uncovered
tip located at $\bm r_0=(x_0,
y_0,z_0)=(0.2\,\text{cm},0.74\,\text{cm},0.9\,\text{cm})$. \notaL{Checa todos estos datos}
We manufactured three samples $G_1$, $G_2$ and $G_3$ by applying a
current $I_1=5\,\text{mA}$, $I_2=10\,\text{mA}$ and
$I_3=20\,\text{mA}$, respectively, during a time of $t=250s$.

The morphologies of the etched porous layers were
observed using a Hitachi SU1510 scanning electron microscope (SEM)
with which we measured the thickness $d$ and the porosity $p$ of the
films at different positions along the sample from its top and side
views (Fig. \ref{fig:DE1}).} \notaL{¿Sí se midió la porosidad con SEM?}

\subsection{Reflectance Measurement}
\label{sec:refl-meas}
We measured the reflectivity spectra at different positions over our
samples using a {\em Perkin Elmer Lambda 950}
UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer.\notaL{Finalmente, ¿fue éste el que se
  usó? Si sí, ¿hay algo internesante que decir sobre el? Cosas como el
tamaño de mancha, resolución espectral, etc.} For interpretation of the
data layer we used
the standard formula \cite{T8,T9} for the reflectance of three media:
air (0) environment, the PS film (1) and the c-Si substrate (2),
 \begin{equation}\label{Eq:ECMR}
   R=\left |\frac{r _ {_ {01}}r _ {_ {12}} e^{2i\delta}}{1+r _ {_
   {01}}r _ {_ {12}} e^{2i\delta}}\right |^2
\end{equation}
where $r_{01}$ and $r_{12}$ are the Fresnel reflectance
coefficients of the air/PS and PS/c-Si interfaces \cite{T10,T11}
and $\delta=k_1^\perp d$, where $k_1^\perp$ is
the component of the wavevector perpendicular to the surface within
the porous layer of thickness $d$. The reflectance depends on the
thickness of the film and on the index of refraction $n_1=n_{\text{PS}}$ of the porous
layer, which we relate to the porosity through Bruggeman's
effective medium theory \cite{I20},
\begin{equation}\label{Eq:Brugg}
 p\frac{1-\epsilon_1} {1+\epsilon_1} + (1-p)
  \frac{\epsilon_2 - \epsilon_1}
  {\epsilon_2+\epsilon_1}=0,
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_2=\epsilon_{\text{Si}}$ is the dielectric function of
the c-Si substrate, and
$\epsilon_1=n_{\text{PS}}^2$ is the dielectric function of the PS layer.
We fitted the reflectance spectra using the porosity $p$ and the
thickness $d$ and a scale calibration factor $s$ as fitting
parameters, and thus, we obtained the porosity
$p$ and the etching rate $v=d/t$ for different values of the local
current density $j_\perp$ expected at several positions on different
samples.

\section{Discussion and Results}
\label{sec:discussion-results}
\subsection{Current Density}
\label{sec:current-density}
\begin{figure}

  \caption{Normalized current density $j_\perp(x,y,0)/I$ calculated a

    Eq. (\ref{Eq:J}) for a
    system as in Figs. \ref{f:celda} and \ref{fig:DE1} for a cell of
    length $a = 2.01\,\text{cm}$ and width $b=1.48\,\text{cm}$, with
    the surface of the electrolyte at a heigth $c=1.0\,\text{cm}$, with a
    point-like electrode at $\bm r_0=(0.2\,\text{cm},
    0.74\,\text{cm},0.9\,\text{cm})$ (top panel). Normalized current
    along the center line $y=0.74\,\text{cm}$ (bottom
    panel).}
  \label{fig:DR1}
\end{figure}
In Fig. \ref{fig:DR1} we show the current density $j_\perp(x,y,0)$ calculated through
Eq. \eqref{Eq:J} at the surface of the sample for our cell, as shown
in Figs. \ref{f:celda} and \ref{fig:DE1} and described in
Sect. \ref{sec:fabrication-ps-grin}). For these parameters we obtained
a large range of values for $ j_\perp/I\sim 0.11-.72\,\text{cm}^{-2}$
that vary mostly along the $x$ direction. Of course, this would differ
for cells with different aspect ratios.

\subsection{Samples }
\label{sec:ps-grin-single}
\begin{figure}
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{G3I20proc}
  \caption{ Photograph of sample $G_3$ prepared as described in
    Sec. \ref{sec:fabrication-ps-grin} using the same parameters as
    in Fig. \ref{fig:DR1} with a current $ I_3=20 \text{mA}$,
    during a time $t=250\text{s}$. We indicate eight regions $x_i$
    $(i=1, 2,...8)$ centered at positions,
    $x'_1=0.2\text{cm}$,  $x'_2=0.4\text{cm}$, $x'_3=0.6\text{cm}$,
    $x'_4=0.8\text{cm}$, $x'_5=1\text{cm}$, $x'_6=1.2\text{cm}$,
    $x'_7=1.4\text{cm}$, $x'_8=1.6\text{cm}$, with $y_n=0.74\,\text{cm}$
    on which we measured reflectance spectra. Here,
    $x'_n=x_n+0.14\,\text{cm}$ is the position from the sealing o-ring.}
  \label{fig:SI3}
\end{figure}

In Fig. \ref{fig:SI3} we show a photograph of one of our samples,
$G_3$
prepared as described in Sec. \ref{sec:fabrication-ps-grin}, with the
same conditions as those corresponding to Fig.~\ref{fig:DR1} applying
a current
$I_3=20\,\text{mA}$ during a time $t=250\,s$. We notice a series of
visible interference fringes that get wider as we move towards the
right end of the sample, consistent with a inhomogeneous film that
gets thinner towards the right, and qualitatively consistent with
Fig. \ref{fig:DR1} that shows a current density that decays towards
the right. Equal color lines seem to correspond to iso-current lines of
Fig. \ref{fig:SI3}, except very close to the the walls of the cell,
where the film rapidly becomes very narrow. The reason is that there
is a small region below the cell walls where the electrolyte penetrates
up to the sealing o-ring (see upper panel of
Fig. \ref{fig:DE1}) and towards which the current leaks from the
neighborhood of the wall. The width of this region is
$w=0.14\,\text{cm}$. Thus, we may expect our formula \eqref{Eq:J}
to fail within that region and close to the border, at distances of the order of the radius
of the cross-section of the o-ring, of the order of a milimeter. The
figure shows eight positions
$x'_n=0.2\,\text{cm},0.4\,\text{cm},\ldots,1.6\,\text{cm}$ on which we
measured the near normal incidence reflection spectra of the
sample. Here, we defined $x'_n=x_n+w$ as the distance to the sealing o-ring,
where $x_n$ is the corresponding distance to the wall of the
cell.

From Eq. \eqref{Eq:J} we evaluate the
normalized current density $j_\perp/I$ expected at the positions $n$ indicated in
Fig. \ref{fig:SI3}.
(Table \ref{t:xj}).

\subsection{Reflectance}

\begin{figure}
  \centering

  experimental results and results fitted through
  equations~\eqref{Eq:ECMR} and \eqref{Eq:Brugg}}.

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

  experimental results and results fitted through
  equations~\eqref{Eq:ECMR} and \eqref{Eq:Brugg}}.
  \label{fig:R20}
\end{figure}

We measured the reflectance spectra  at the positions indicated in
Fig. \ref{fig:SI3} on our three samples $G_1$, $G_2$,
and$G_3$, prepared using the same procedure
(Sec. \ref{sec:fabrication-ps-grin}) but applying different currents
$I_1=5\,\text{mA}$, $I_2=10\,\text{mA}$, and $I_3=20\,\text{mA}$, . The results are shown in
Figs. \ref{fig:R5}, \ref{fig:R10}, and \ref{fig:R20}.
We fitted the reflectance measurements using Eqs. \eqref{Eq:ECMR} and
\eqref{Eq:Brugg} using the local porosity $p$, and the thickness of the
film  $d$ as
adjustable parameters. We also fitted a scaling parameter $s$ to allow
for calibration variations among spectra. From the thickness we
obtained the etching rate $v=d/t$ at each position. Notice that the fit is reasonably
good. The contrast of the reflectance in the experiment is somewhat smaller
than in our fitted curves. We believe this is due to the finite width
\notaL{beams width=?} of the illuminating beam of our
spectrometer. Thus, as our GRIN sample is not macroscopically homogeneous and its
properties have a gradient, the
experimental results have contributions from regions with slightly
different porosities and thicknesses, averaging out the interference
maxima and minima. We also expect microscopic inhomogeneities such as
interface roughness that might also reduce the contrast.
This is most notable for the thicker regions
towards the left side of Fig. \ref{fig:SI3} and for smaller
wavelengths.

The results obtained from the reflectance fits are summarized in table
\ref{t:jpdv}. Notice that the scaling parameters are close to 1,
showing that the calibration was adequate. \notaL{Is this meaningful?}.

\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{t:jpdv}
  Current density and fitted parameters for saveral positions on
  three samples:  porosity, thickness, scale factor and etching rate.}
\end{table}

From the data in Table \ref{t:jpdv} we can plot the fitted porosity as
a function of the calculated density current, as shown for our three
samples in Fig. \ref{fig:p}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pvsj}
  \caption{Porosity as a function of current density for three samples
    $G_1$, $G_2$, $G_3$. The data points for each sample are joined by
    thick lines. The arrows point to data that correspond to
    position $x'_1=0.2\,\text{cm}$, joined to the other data by a thin
    line (see text). We include linear fits to the data from
    sample $G_3$ (thick straight line) and to that from all the
    samples (thin straight line). }
  \label{fig:p}
\end{figure}
Notice that for each sample the data points lie around straight lines,
except for one outlier point in each corresponding to position
$x'_1$. As discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:ps-grin-single}, those points
were very close to a wall of the electrolytic cell, so they were
affected by leakage currents towards the underside of the wall.
For this reason, we exclude those points from the following
analysis. We made a linear fit to the data from sample $G_3$ and to
the data from the three samples. A comparison shows that a fit to the
data of just one sample, $G_3$, turns out to be a reasonable predictor for the
porosity of all the samples.  From that fit we obtain that for our
preparation conditions
\begin{equation}\label{eq:p}
  p\approx 0.013\frac{\text{cm}^2}{\text{mA}} j_\perp+0.53.
\end{equation}

Similarly, we can plot the fitted etching rate as
a function of the calculated density current, as shown for our three
samples in Fig. \ref{fig:v}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{vvsj}
  \caption{Etching rate as a function of current density for three samples

    line (see text). We include linear fits to the data from
    sample $G_3$ (thick straight line) and to that from all the
    samples (thin straight line). }
  \label{fig:v}
\end{figure}
As for the porosity, there are outlier points corresponding to the
immediate proximity of the wall of the cell, but the remaining points
lie on straight lines for each sample, and they
may all be approximated by a linear fit to the data of just one
sample, $G_3$, from which we get
\begin{equation}\label{eq:v}
  v\approx 0.35\frac{\text{cm}^2}{\text{mA}}
  \frac{\text{nm}}{\text{s}}j_\perp + 0.092\frac{\text{nm}}{{s}}.
\end{equation}

Using Eqs. \eqref{eq:p}, \eqref{eq:v}, \eqref{Eq:ECMR}, and
\eqref{Eq:Brugg}, we can calculate the reflectance spectra for any
desired current density $j_\perp$ and etching time. This is
illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:Rvsjl} for the parameters that correspond
to our samples.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{jlr}
  \caption{Reflection $R$ of a PS film as a function of the current density

    panel, see text). We indicate with the numbers 1, 2, 3 the
    data corresponding to the corresponding samples $G_1$, $G_2$ and
    $G_3$.}
  \label{fig:Rvsjl}
\end{figure}
On the right hand side of the figure we display a quilt made by
patching together the experimental reflectance data corresponding to
Figs. \ref{fig:R5}- \ref{fig:R20}, ordered according to the
corresponding current density as presented in Table
\ref{t:jpdv}. Nevertheless, for the reasons mentioned above, we
eliminated the data corresponding to position $x'_1$ on all
samples. Furthermore, as the results corresponding to sample $G_2$ in
Figs. \ref{fig:p} and  \ref{fig:v} seem shifted with respect to those
of the other samples, in order to facilitate the visualization of the
results, we artificially shifted horizontally towards the
right their contributions to Fig. \ref{fig:Rvsjl} by
$1\,\text{mA}/\text{cm}^2$. Notice that the experimental results may
be grouped along bright and dark bands and that they correspond closely to
those expected theoretically, though the experimental bands are somewhat shifted,
especially for low current densities, and the minima are not as low.

The theoretical reflectance coudl as well be calculated using
Eqs. \eqref{eq:p}, \eqref{eq:v}, \eqref{Eq:ECMR}, and
\eqref{Eq:Brugg}, for more complicated structures, in which the
current $I$ is modulated in time, allowing the design and analysis of
non-trivial multilayered GRIN PS structures.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
By choosing a simple geometry for our electrochemical cell, namely, a
rectangular prism, and employing a point-like electrode, we were able
to derive an expression for the calculation of the electric current
density along the surface of a Si sample. The expression was obtained
by using image charge theory and a planewise summation of Coulomb
potentials in 2D reciprocal space, and it is made up of
a rapidly converging sum of analytical terms, just a few of which
should be kept. This allows the characterization
of the porosity of a PS layer and the etching
rate for different values of the etching current density by making
optical measurements on several positions of just a
few samples. We illustrated the procedure with three samples on each of which we
measured reflectance spectra at eight different positions.
Through a optimization procedure we fitted the porosity and etching
rate corresponding to each current density.
We showed that an analysis of the data of just one of the samples, which we chose
as that with the largest current density range, yielded calibration
curves that allow the approximate prediction of the properties of the other
samples. The calibration curves can be used to design and calculate the optical
properties of other systems prepared under similar conditions, such as
multilayered GRIN systems from which photonic crystals, microcavities
and sensors with position dependent properties. This is the subject of
ongoing work. As the etching rate for the formation of porous silicon
and the resulting porosity are very sensitive to the growth conditions
and to the properties of the substrate, such as its doping,
there are no universal calibration curves. Thus, it is useful to have
a procedure that from just one sample can produce calibration curves
that may be employed for other samples grown in the same conditions.
